    <h1>Pole Treatment Protocol</h1>

    <p>The 5-step process is <strong>identical across all designs</strong> and is absolutely non-negotiable. Untreated eucalyptus fails in 5-10 years. Properly treated timber lasts 30-40 years above ground.</p>

    <CalloutBox variant="tip" title="Eucalyptus Species Selection">
        <p>For structural poles, select <strong>E. globulus</strong> (blue gum) or <strong>E. grandis</strong> (flooded gum). These species have characteristic bending strength of 25+ MPa. Avoid E. camaldulensis for primary rafters—its strength is more variable. Source poles 15-18cm diameter at the butt end for main rafters.</p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <CalloutBox variant="danger" title="This is not optional">
        <p>Skip pole treatment and your building will be colonized by carpenter ants within 3 years. Follow this protocol and your timber will last 30-40 years.</p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <ProcessStep number={1} title="Debark Within 48 Hours">
        <p>Remove bark immediately after felling while wood is fresh. Use a drawknife or scraper. Bark traps moisture and prevents preservative penetration.</p>
    </ProcessStep>

    <ProcessStep number={2} title="Borax Soak (72+ Hours)">
        <p>Submerge poles completely in borax solution. They float, so weight them down with stones or a weighted board. Minimum 72 hours; longer (up to 2 weeks) is better for deep penetration.</p>
    </ProcessStep>

    <h4>Construction Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Excavate trench:</strong> 6m × 0.8m × 0.5m deep, with flat bottom and squared sides</li>
        <li><strong>Remove sharp stones:</strong> Line bottom with 5cm sand or old carpet scraps</li>
        <li><strong>Install liner:</strong> EPDM pond liner (1mm) or heavy polyethylene (200+ micron). Allow 30cm excess on all sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure edges:</strong> Weight liner edges with stones or timber. Don't puncture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add loading ramps:</strong> Place timber rails at each end—poles slide in/out without damaging liner</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This creates approximately a 2% solution—sufficient for insect and fungal protection. Dissolve borax and boric acid in hot water first, then add to trough.</p>

    <h4>Batch Processing Workflow</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Load batch:</strong> Slide 15-20 debarked poles into trough using ramps</li>
        <li><strong>Submerge:</strong> Weight down with stones or a board weighted with concrete blocks</li>
        <li><strong>Cover:</strong> Lay tarp or corrugated sheets over trough to reduce evaporation</li>
        <li><strong>Soak 72+ hours:</strong> Flip poles halfway through if any surfaces exposed</li>
        <li><strong>Remove and stack:</strong> Slide poles out, stack on raised rails to dry</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Solution remains effective for 6-8 batches before needing refresh</li>
    </ol>

    <CalloutBox variant="tip" title="Reusing the Solution">
        <p>The borax solution doesn't "wear out"—it absorbs into the wood but concentration drops slowly. After 6-8 batches, test by drying a sample: white crystalline residue on the surface indicates adequate concentration. Top up with fresh solution as water evaporates.</p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <CalloutBox variant="warning" title="After the Build">
        <p>The trough can be repurposed: fill with gravel for a French drain, convert to a raised bed, or simply fill in. The dilute borax solution is not hazardous—borax is used in garden soil as a trace mineral (boron).</p>
    </CalloutBox>

    <ProcessStep number={3} title="Dry 2-3 Weeks Under Cover">
        <p>Stack treated poles on raised supports in a shaded, well-ventilated area. Protect from rain. Stack with spacers between layers for air circulation.</p>
    </ProcessStep>

    <ProcessStep number={4} title="Char Bottom 50cm (Deep Char Method)">
        <p>Torch the lower 50cm of each pole until the char layer reaches <strong>8-10mm depth</strong>. You should see alligator-scale cracking in the char layer. After charring, brush off loose char with a stiff wire brush.</p>
        <CalloutBox variant="warning" title="Why Char When Poles Sit on Gabion?">
            <p>All BioDome designs place poles on gabion foundations with HDPE wrapping—no direct soil contact. However, 8-10mm charring remains valuable as a <strong>redundancy layer</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HDPE wrapping has a 15-25 year service life; char protection is indefinite</li>
                <li>If HDPE gets damaged during construction or maintenance, char layer provides backup</li>
                <li>Charred surfaces don't absorb splash moisture from rain hitting the gabion</li>
                <li>Conservative design: protects against installation errors, unforeseen settling, or drainage failures</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The char depth isn't because poles touch ground—they don't. It's because a single moisture barrier (HDPE alone) isn't sufficient for a 30-40 year structure. Test depth by scraping with a knife.</p>

    <ProcessStep number={5} title="Seal with Hot Linseed Oil">
        <p>Heat linseed oil to 60-70°C. Brush on all pole surfaces. The oil hardens over 2-3 days and waterproofs the wood while remaining breathable. Reapply every 5-10 years.</p>
