import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This timeline assumes 2-3 people working most days. Drying periods are not idle time — use them to prepare materials for the next phase.

<Steps>

1. **Site Prep & Pole Harvest (Week 1)**

   - Clear eucalyptus from building footprint + 3m buffer (including porch area)
   - Mark center point and 3m radius
   - Harvest 18 arch poles (8-10cm, ~11.6m) — green (16 needed + 2 spares)
   - Harvest ring poles for horizontal rings (5-7cm dia) — these can be borax-soaked with the arch poles if desired, or kept green under shade wraps for use in Weeks 3-4
   - Score and pair arch poles (8 pairs, including door-framing pair)
   - Treat door, window frame, and wind porch corner posts (borax soak)

2. **Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**

   - Identify outlet point (lowest grade)
   - Excavate ring trench (35cm deep at outlet, sloped 1–2%)
   - Line with geotextile, lay gravel bed and perforated pipe
   - Connect outlet pipe to daylight downhill
   - Assemble gabion cages, fill with stone over pipe
   - Fold geotextile over top, level bearing surface, mark sockets
   - Build wind porch U-shaped gabion extension at door opening
   - Test drain, allow foundation to settle (3–5 days)

3. **Dome Frame (Week 2-3)**

   - Erect temporary center post (4m)
   - Raise all 8 arch pairs (7 standard + 1 door-framing) — bend poles live
   - Install wind porch frame: 4 corner posts, ridge poles, rafters, outer lintel
   - Wire-lash crown crossing (all 16 poles)
   - Lock pole bases into foundation
   - Install door frame at porch outer end

4. **Wattle Weave (Weeks 3-4)**

   - Harvest wattle infill poles fresh (3-5cm dia, ~200 pcs) — weave the same day
   - Install 7 horizontal rings from bottom up
   - Weave vertical infill between rings
   - Weave wind porch sidewalls and roof infill
   - Install window frames and window box frame members
   - Density check — no gaps larger than a fist

5. **Straw-Clay Shell (Weeks 4-5 + 2-4 weeks drying)**

   - Mix clay slip, coat straw
   - Apply to exterior in 25mm layers, bottom up
   - Apply straw-clay to wind porch sidewalls (same 100mm build-up)
   - Fill window box cheek walls with small-scale wattle and straw-clay
   - Pin burlap strips on upper dome to hold material
   - Smooth final surface
   - Allow 2-4 weeks to dry completely

   *Use drying time to prepare interior: compact floor base, mix lime plaster, build furniture.*

6. **Weatherproofing (Weeks 5-6)**

   - Drape burlap over dried straw-clay, staple in place
   - Apply porch EPDM first (roof, sidewalls) at the dome junction zone
   - Apply dome EPDM in horizontal bands, bottom up — lap OVER porch EPDM at junction
   - Cut EPDM picture-frame at each window, fold flaps into box, seal
   - Install window sill flashing with 5-degree outward slope and drip edge
   - Seal all seams with primer + tape (15cm overlap minimum)
   - Install base flashing at gabion
   - Build and install apex rain cap
   - **Hose test for 30 minutes — fix all leaks, especially porch junction and window sills**

7. **Exterior Finish (Weeks 6-7)**

   - Stack stone skirt against EPDM from gabion top to 60-80cm — extend across porch sidewalls
   - Drape wire mesh over EPDM above stone zone, tuck under collar and behind stone skirt
   - Apply lime-earth render scratch coat (8-10mm) to dome and porch upper walls, allow to cure 5-7 days
   - Apply lime-earth render finish coat (5-8mm)
   - Plant climbing vines at base of stone skirt

   *The stone skirt can begin as soon as the EPDM hose test passes. Render and interior plaster can proceed in parallel.*

8. **Interior Finish (Weeks 7-9)**

   - Apply lime plaster scratch coat to interior (including porch interior)
   - Install floor (earthen, lime concrete, or timber)
   - Apply lime plaster finish coat
   - Apply 3-4 coats of limewash
   - Install door at porch outer frame, glaze windows in outer box frames

</Steps>

:::tip[Real Timeline]
The active work takes about 20-25 days spread over 4-9 weeks, depending on drying conditions. In a Portuguese summer, drying is fast and you can finish in 4-5 weeks. In winter, allow 8-10 weeks for straw-clay, exterior render, and interior plaster to cure properly.
