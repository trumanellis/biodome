title: Floor Plan
description: 28m² circular layout with suggested zones — living center, kitchen, sleeping platform, entry, and storage perimeter.
---

28m² in a circle. The dome shape naturally creates zones: the center is for standing and activity, the edges are for resting and storage. Work with the shape, not against it.

## Suggested Layout

- **Center zone (0-1.5m from center, ~7m²):** Living space. Table, chairs, central heating if used (rocket mass heater or wood stove). Full headroom.
- **South arc (kitchen, ~5m²):** Kitchen counter along the south wall near a window. Passive solar gain warms this zone in winter.
- **Sleeping platform (north arc, ~6m²):** Low platform (30-40cm high) built against the north wall where the ceiling slopes down. The low ceiling over the platform is comfortable for lying down.
- **Entry zone (at door + wind porch, ~5m²):** The wind porch provides ~2m² of enclosed airlock space for coats, boots, and weather transition. Inside the dome, a further ~3m² serves as the entry landing.
- **Storage perimeter (~7m²):** Shelving and hooks around the lower walls where headroom is 1-1.8m. This ring of storage defines the interior zones without needing partition walls.

## Design Principles

- **Door orientation:** Face east or southeast. Morning sun warms the entry. Away from prevailing winter rain (which comes from the west/southwest in Portugal).
- **South window:** Largest window on the south side for winter solar gain.
- **North side:** No windows needed. Use this wall for the sleeping platform.
- **Built-in furniture:** Benches and platforms following the curve are more space-efficient than freestanding furniture.
- **Heating:** A small wood stove with chimney exiting through the dome wall (not the apex vent) is the most practical. Size it for the space — 28m² needs a very small stove.

:::tip[Bathroom]
At 28m², an internal bathroom is possible but tight. A separate outdoor composting toilet and simple outdoor shower (solar-heated bag) is a better use of space. If you need an enclosed bathroom, consider a small attached structure outside the dome with its own roof.
