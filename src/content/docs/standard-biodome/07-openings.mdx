## Arch Door (Double Bay)

The door spans a double bay — two pole spacings wide, created by skipping one socket. The eighth arch pair — the door-framing pair — fans from the two sockets opposite the door, and its thin ends land at the two sockets flanking the opening, forming a natural arch over the entrance. This gives a generous ~2m-wide doorway.

- **Width:** ~2m (spanning two pole bays)
- **Shape:** The fanning pair curves apart as it descends from the crown, creating a pointed arch that separates at roughly 2.2m height. Below that, two treated chestnut or pine posts (10cm diameter) stiffen the straight sides down to the foundation.
- **Frame:** Two treated chestnut or pine posts set into the gabion, rising to 1.5m. Above 1.5m, the fanning pair's descending thin ends provide the arch.
- **Threshold:** Treated timber sill beam across the foundation at the base of the opening
- **Door itself:** Double ledge-and-brace timber doors (each leaf ~1m wide), or a heavy curtain for warm months

Install the door frame posts during the dome frame phase, before weaving. The door-framing pair is installed after the seven standard pairs (see [Raising the Arches, Step 4](/standard-biodome/03-dome-frame/#raising-the-arches)). The wattle weave terminates at the door edges on each side.

## Wind Porch (Katak)

The 6m catenary dome wall leans roughly 15 degrees inward from vertical at the base. A door frame mounted directly on this slanted surface will not hang plumb, the sill will slope inward, and rain drives straight in. The wind porch solves all three problems: a short arched tunnel projecting outward from the dome at the door, inspired by the igloo katak (entrance tunnel). The porch arch profile matches the door — straight walls up to 1.5m, then a curved arch to the peak — so the two read as one continuous opening.

</figure>

### Dimensions
- **Projection:** 1.2m outward from dome face
- **Width:** 2m (matches double-bay door opening)
- **Height:** 2.2m at inner end (dome arch), 2.0m at outer door frame
- **Internal clear depth:** ~1.0m (after wall thickness)

### Structure
- 4 corner posts (10cm treated chestnut/pine, plumb vertical) in gabion footings — posts rise to 1.5m (where the arch begins)
- 2 side eave poles connecting inner to outer posts at 1.5m (arch spring line)
- Inner arch frame matching the dome door arch profile (peak at 2.2m)
- Outer arch frame matching the same profile (peak at 2.0m — slightly lower for roof drainage)
- 5 arch rafters curving from inner arch to outer arch, forming a barrel-vault roof
- Wattle-weave sidewalls below the arch spring line and infill between rafters
- Same layer stack as dome: straw-clay (100mm), burlap, EPDM, stone skirt + lime render

### Foundation
U-shaped gabion extension: two 1.2m arms projecting from the main ring at the door edges, connected by a cross piece. Same specs as the main ring (40cm wide, 65cm deep, geotextile-lined). See [Foundation, Step 8](/standard-biodome/02-foundation/#construction-sequence).

:::danger[EPDM Junction — Critical Detail]
The junction between the dome EPDM and the porch EPDM is the single most leak-prone point on the structure. Follow this order exactly:

1. **Apply porch EPDM first** at the junction zone — roof and sidewalls of the porch.
2. **Apply dome EPDM lapping OVER the porch EPDM** — water flows dome, then porch, then outward. The upper layer always overlaps the lower.
3. **All junctions:** 15cm overlap, EPDM primer on both surfaces, seam tape rolled firmly.

Include this junction in every hose test and every seasonal inspection.

:::tip[What the Porch Gives You]
A plumb outer door frame (doors hang straight, sills are level). A thermal airlock (interior stays warm when you open the outer door). A rain and wind buffer (no direct weather exposure). A place to hang coats and remove boots. All built from the same materials as the dome.

## Arch Windows & Window Boxes

Install 2-3 arch-topped windows in the natural bays between adjacent arch poles. The poles act as the window jambs, so you only need to add a sill beam, two short vertical stiles, and a curved arch frame at the top.

Like the door, each window sits on a dome wall that leans inward. A 20cm-deep window box projects outward from each opening, giving a plumb outer frame for the glazing.

- **Shape:** Rectangular below, arch-topped above — following the natural curve between two poles
- **Size:** ~95cm wide (the natural pole spacing) × ~110cm from sill to arch peak
- **Sill height:** 70cm above foundation (comfortable seated eye level)
- **Inner frame:** Treated chestnut or pine: horizontal sill beam, two short stiles up to where the arch begins (~1.3m), then a curved arch frame to the peak (~1.8m). Install during the dome frame phase, before weaving.
- **Window box:** 4 short treated frame members (20cm long) at each corner project outward from the dome EPDM surface. Small-scale wattle and straw-clay cheek walls fill between the dome surface and the outer frame.
- **Outer frame:** Plumb frame at the outer end of the box, with rebate for glazing.
- **Glazing:** Fixed polycarbonate sheet (6mm), mounted in the plumb outer frame with butyl tape seal. The polycarbonate sits in the rebate of the outer frame — plumb, not leaning.
- **Sill slope:** 5 degrees outward for drainage, with an EPDM drip edge extending 5cm past the outer face.
- **Placement:** At least one window opposite the door for cross-ventilation. Orient the largest window south for passive solar gain in winter.

### Window Box EPDM Detail

Cut the dome EPDM in a picture-frame pattern at each window opening. Fold the four flaps into the box sides and seal to the frame members with primer and seam tape. The sill flashing is a separate EPDM piece that covers the sill, slopes outward at 5 degrees, laps over the dome EPDM below the window, and extends 5cm past the outer face as a drip edge.

:::tip[Keep It Simple]
In a Portuguese climate, you can get away with fewer windows than you think. The apex vent and door provide substantial airflow. Three arch windows — one south, one on the side, and one opposite the door — give good light and cross-ventilation.

## Apex Vent

The 30-40cm opening at the crown of the dome serves as the primary ventilation. Hot air rises and exits here, drawing fresh air in through the door and windows.

- **Opening:** 30-40cm diameter, formed at the center of the crown crossing where all 16 poles (8 pairs) overlap
- **Rain cap:** A conical cap on a short post (like a chimney cowl), mounted 15-20cm above the opening. Allows air flow while deflecting rain.
- **Construction:** Bend 4 thin poles into a cone, cover with a small piece of EPDM. Mount on a 20cm post anchored to the crown crossing.
- **Closure:** For cold nights, stuff the opening with a removable cushion or plug from inside.
