## Lime Plaster Walls

The interior of the wattle dome receives two coats of lime plaster. This seals the structure, reflects light, and provides fire resistance.

1. **Scratch coat:** 1 part hydraulic lime : 3 parts sharp sand. Press firmly into the wattle gaps. Score the surface with a comb while wet.
2. **Finish coat:** 1 part lime putty : 2.5 parts fine sand. Apply 3-5mm thick over the cured scratch coat. Trowel smooth.
3. **Limewash:** Thin lime putty diluted with water. Apply 3-4 coats by brush. This brightens the interior considerably — important in a dome where natural light is limited.

## Floor

Three practical options:

- **Earthen floor (simplest):** Compacted earth base, lime-stabilized top layer (1 part lime : 4 parts earth), sealed with linseed oil. Cool in summer, can be cold in winter — use rugs.
- **Lime concrete:** 1 part hydraulic lime : 2 parts sand : 3 parts gravel, 10cm thick over compacted gravel base. More durable than earthen, warmer underfoot.
- **Timber deck:** Raised timber floor on eucalyptus sleepers. Creates an air gap for insulation and moisture management. Most comfortable but most expensive.
