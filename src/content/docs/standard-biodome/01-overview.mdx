The Standard BioDome is a 6-meter wattle dome. Sixteen full-length eucalyptus poles, paired into eight arches, span the full dome diameter and cross at the apex. Seven pairs cross straight across; the eighth pair fans from two sockets opposite the door to frame the entrance. Wattle weave fills the gaps. Straw-clay insulates the outside. EPDM keeps the rain out. Two or three people can build the whole thing.

There is no ring beam, no complex rafter assembly. The dome is one continuous structure from foundation to apex. The shape approximates a catenary — the natural curve a hanging chain makes, inverted. The poles are not forced into a mathematically precise shape; they find their own curve under gravity. This keeps the structure predominantly in compression, which is what timber does best.

## Key Specifications

- **Shape:** Approximately catenary (stays predominantly in compression — no outward thrust)
- **Floor area:** 28m² (comparable to a Mongolian ger)
- **Standing area:** ~20m² where headroom exceeds 1.8m
- **Roof:** EPDM membrane over straw-clay insulation
- **Exterior:** Stone skirt, lime-earth render, climbing plants — no visible membrane
- **Crew:** 2-3 people for entire build
- **Trees removed:** 50-100 eucalyptus saplings and young trees
- **Build time:** ~4-5 weeks in summer (longer in winter)
- **Lifespan:** 25-35 years with maintenance

## Headroom by Zone

A dome is not a box. Headroom varies from center to edge. This is a feature, not a limitation — the edges create natural zones for sitting, sleeping, and storage.

| Distance from Center | Approximate Height | Suitable For |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 0-1m | 3.8-4.0m | Full standing, central hearth |
| 1-2m | 2.5-3.8m | Standing, kitchen, workspace |
| 2-2.5m | 1.8-2.5m | Standing (edge), shelving |
| 2.5-3m | 0.8-1.8m | Sleeping platforms, seating, storage |
