## Essential Tools Checklist

### Eucalyptus Eradication
- **Herbicide applicator:** Squeeze bottle with flip-top, triclopyr gel, or dauber bottle
- Nitrile gloves (multiple pairs)
- Safety glasses

### Pole Harvesting & Treatment
- Chainsaw + safety gear (chaps, helmet, ear protection)
- Drawknife or bark spud (for debarking)
- Soaking trough: 6m × 0.8m × 0.5m trench lined with EPDM or heavy poly (see [Treatment section](/fundamentals/03-treatment/))
- Weights to keep poles submerged (stones or weighted board)
- Propane torch with regulator and 5m hose
- Stiff wire brush (for cleaning char)
- Cooking thermometer (to verify linseed oil at 60-70°C)
- Pin moisture meter (to verify pole dryness ≤20%)

### Construction
- Long spirit level (2m minimum) or laser level
- String line and stakes (for layout)
- Drill with 6mm and 10mm bits
- Heavy hammer or mallet
- Wire cutters and pliers
- Chisel set (for cutting notches)
- Come-along or ratchet straps
- Scaffolding or sturdy ladders

### Temporary Construction Items
- **Center support tower:** ~4.5m tall temporary structure for roof assembly
- **Ground rehearsal space:** 12m × 12m clear flat area for laying out roof
- **Blocking and wedges:** Wood scraps for shimming
