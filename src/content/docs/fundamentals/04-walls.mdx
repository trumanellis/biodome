## Why Light Straw-Clay?

Traditional cob (dense clay-sand-straw mixture) presents challenges when used as infill between eucalyptus poles that shrink 5-8% as they dry.

:::tip[The Problem with Cob Infill]
Cob is rigid and heavy (~1,800 kg/m³). When eucalyptus poles shrink and shift during drying, cob cracks at the pole junctions — sometimes severely.
:::

**Light straw-clay** solves this by reversing the ratio: instead of clay with straw reinforcement, it's straw with clay coating. The result is a lightweight (~400 kg/m³), flexible infill that:

- **Absorbs frame movement** internally rather than cracking
- **Dries faster** (4-6 weeks vs 2-3 months for cob)
- **Easier to repair** (stuff more straw into gaps)
- **More forgiving to mix** (less skill required)
- **Reduces load on frame** (1/4 the weight of cob)

## The Recipe

| Ingredient | Description | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Straw | Loose, long-fiber (wheat, rye, or rice straw) | Bulk material — creates insulation and structure |
| Clay slip | Clay + water to thick cream/yogurt consistency | Coating — binds straw, provides fire resistance |

**No sand.** Unlike cob, light straw-clay uses pure clay slip without aggregate.

## Making Clay Slip

<Steps>

1. **Soak Clay Overnight**

   Put clay soil in a container, cover with water. Let sit 12-24 hours to fully hydrate.

2. **Mix to Yogurt Consistency**

   Stir vigorously. Add water until the slip coats your hand and drips off slowly — like thick yogurt.

3. **Strain if Needed**

   If your clay soil has stones, strain through a coarse screen.

</Steps>

## Coating the Straw

<Steps>

1. **Toss Straw in Slip**

   Work in manageable batches. Toss loose straw into slip and turn until all fibers are lightly coated. The straw should glisten but not drip.

2. **Don't Saturate**

   More slip is NOT better. Saturated straw takes longer to dry and loses insulation value.

</Steps>

## Packing the Wall Cavity

1. Work between wattle poles in 15-20cm lifts
2. Pack coated straw firmly into the cavity
3. Tamp with a flat board or your fist
4. Don't over-compress (you want insulation value)
5. Continue until cavity is filled to the next wattle level
6. Final wall thickness: 35-45cm

:::caution[Tamping Technique]
Tamp firmly but not aggressively. The packed wall should feel springy, not solid.

## Drying Time

- **Per 15cm depth:** 1-2 weeks to dry through
- **Total wall drying:** 4-6 weeks
- **Test for dryness:** Push a thin stick into the wall — if it comes out damp, keep waiting
- **Good ventilation:** Essential during drying

## Fire Resistance

Clay-coated straw is fire-resistant — the clay coating prevents the straw from igniting easily. In fire tests, light straw-clay chars on the surface but doesn't sustain flame.

## Repairs

- **Small gaps from settling:** Stuff with more clay-coated straw
- **Gaps at pole junctions:** Pack additional straw around poles after they've finished shrinking (typically after first year)
- **Cracks in render:** Standard lime render repair
