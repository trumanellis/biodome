:::danger[Critical Understanding]
This is an **eradication project**. The goal is to **permanently kill** the eucalyptus trees and enable native forest recovery. Every stump must be treated to prevent regrowth.

## Cut-Stump Treatment (95-98% Success)

This is the gold standard for eucalyptus eradication:

<Steps>

1. **Cut at Ground Level**

   Fell the tree as close to ground as possible using a chainsaw. Make the cut clean and horizontal.

2. **Treat Stump Immediately**

   **Within 15 minutes:** Apply 25-50% glyphosate solution or 15-25% triclopyr solution to the entire cut surface. Eucalyptus tissue seals quickly — apply before the stump calluses over.

   **Application methods by terrain:**
   - **Squeeze bottle with flip-top (recommended for slopes):** 500ml bottle clips to belt. One-handed operation.
   - **Gel formulation:** Triclopyr gel won't spill, clings to vertical cuts, works in light rain.
   - **Dauber bottle:** Built-in sponge applicator. Good for small stumps.
   - **Paintbrush + jar:** Flat terrain only. Spill hazard on slopes.

3. **Harvest Poles While Fresh**

   During the 1-2 week window while the wood is still workable, harvest poles from the freshly fallen tree. Young poles (2-7 year growth) are ideal for building.

4. **Monitor for Resprouting**

   Check all treated stumps monthly for 12-18 months. Immediately cut and treat any resprouting shoots.

### Comparison Table of All Methods

| Method | Success Rate | Cost/Tree | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------|------|
| Cut + Glyphosate Stump | 95-98% | €0.50-2 | Highest success, fast, uses tree for building | Requires immediate herbicide application |
| Cut + Triclopyr Stump | 95-98% | €1-3 | Works in wet conditions, excellent success | More expensive than glyphosate |
| Triclopyr Gel (RTU) | 95-98% | €2-4 | Won't spill, clings to cuts, works in rain | Most expensive per stump |
| Physical Removal | 100% | €20+ | Complete removal, no regrowth possible | Labor-intensive, requires machinery |
| Cut Only (No Treatment) | 5-10% | €0 | Cheap, fast | High regrowth, builds denser stump sprouts |

### Herbicide Details

#### Glyphosate (Non-selective)
- Concentration for stump treatment: 25-50%
- How it works: Absorbed through freshly cut wood, translocates to roots
- Cost: €3-8 per liter (concentrated)
- Weathering: Rain-resistant after 1-2 hours

#### Triclopyr (Selective for woody plants)
- Concentration for stump treatment: 15-25%
- How it works: Acts like plant hormone causing uncontrolled growth
- Cost: €8-15 per liter (concentrated)
- Weathering: Works even in wet conditions

### Environmental Profile & Breakdown

#### Glyphosate

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Soil half-life | 2-197 days (avg 47 days) | Highly variable by soil type |
| Water half-life | 7-14 days | Biodegrades relatively quickly |
| Binding | Strong to soil particles | Low leaching risk when applied to stumps |
| Breakdown products | AMPA (aminomethylphosphonic acid) | Also biodegrades, similar timeline |

#### Triclopyr

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Soil half-life | 8-46 days (avg 30 days) | Faster breakdown than glyphosate |
| Water half-life | &lt;1 day (rapid photolysis) | Very short persistence in water |
| Binding | Moderate | Can leach in sandy soils |
| Breakdown products | TCP (trichloropyridinol) | Biodegrades within weeks |

#### Why Stump Treatment is Lower Impact than Broadcast Spraying
- Application is targeted to cut surface only (~50-100ml per stump)
- No drift to non-target plants
- Herbicide translocates into root system (contained)
- Soil contact is minimal compared to foliar application
- Total herbicide used: ~5-10L for entire project vs. hundreds of liters for broadcast

#### Buffer Zone Recommendations
- 10m from watercourses (streams, springs, ponds)
- 5m from wells or water collection points
- Avoid application if rain expected within 2 hours

:::tip[The Ecological Tradeoff]
One-time targeted herbicide use enables permanent eucalyptus eradication. Without treatment, stumps resprout aggressively — requiring repeated cutting for 5-10 years or continuous herbicide applications. The net environmental impact of successful eradication (restored watershed, eliminated fire risk, native forest recovery) far outweighs the transient soil impact of a single stump treatment.

### Safety Protocols

:::caution[Personal Protective Equipment]
- Gloves: Nitrile or latex (herbicides absorb through skin)
- Eye protection: Safety glasses or goggles
- Skin coverage: Long sleeves, long pants
- Footwear: Closed-toe boots
:::

### Timing and Weather
- **Best season:** Late spring through autumn (trees actively growing)
- **Avoid:** Heavy rain within 2 hours, extreme heat
- **Application time:** Early morning or evening
- **Dry period needed:** At least 1-2 hours after application
