title: Design Variants
description: "Alternative configurations — greenhouse domes, stone igloos, terraced lean-tos, and multi-dome compounds."

The two core designs (Standard BioDome and Earth Sheltered SolarPod) are starting points. The same eucalyptus pole framework adapts to different climates, sites, and needs. Here are some of the directions it can go.

## Greenhouse Variants

Strip back the insulation and cob, keep the wattle frame, and wrap it in transparent panels or greenhouse plastic. The result is a solar greenhouse that doubles as a warm-season living space.

## Stone and Render Variants

Replace the living roof with full stone cladding or heavy lime render. These versions prioritise fire resistance and thermal mass over growing potential.

## Terraced and Earth-Sheltered Variants

Build against an existing slope or stone terrace wall. The earth does most of the insulating. These work especially well on Portugal's steep terraced hillsides.

## Multi-Dome Compounds

A single dome is a house. Several domes connected by covered pathways become a village. Each dome can serve a different function — sleeping, kitchen, workshop, greenhouse — while sharing infrastructure.
