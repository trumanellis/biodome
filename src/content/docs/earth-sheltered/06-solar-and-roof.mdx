## Key Topics

- Living roof substrate: 15–20cm depth, lightweight aggregate mix (perlite, compost, sand)
- Plant selection: sedum species, native grasses, low-maintenance perennials
- North slope coverage: full living roof for thermal mass and fire resistance
- Solar panel mounting: aluminum rail system on south slope, 35° tilt angle
- Structural load: roof designed for 200 kg/m² (living roof + snow + wind)
- Wiring penetrations: conduit through gable end, sealed with EPDM boot
