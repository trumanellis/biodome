## Key Topics

- South-facing door: 2m × 0.9m, double-glazed insulated unit, chestnut frame
- Window placement: two 1m × 0.8m windows flanking door for cross-ventilation
- Chestnut joinery: mortise-and-tenon frames, wedged tight, finished with linseed oil
- Weathersealing: EPDM gaskets at frame perimeter, lime-earth caulk at wattle junction
- Earth-contact transition: frames set proud of earth-banked walls, no buried wood
- Hardware: stainless steel hinges, passive vents for humidity control
