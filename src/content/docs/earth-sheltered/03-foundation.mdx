## Key Topics

- Gabion cage sizing: 1m × 0.5m × 0.5m units (or custom to fit cut profile)
- Stone fill: 10–20cm local granite or schist, hand-placed at corners and edges
- Retaining wall integration: stepped courses following hillside cut
- Front foundation: single gabion course at south face, anchors wattle wall frame
- Pole anchor points: flat stone caps on gabion units, 40cm spacing
- Drainage pipe routing: 100mm perforated HDPE at base of rear and side walls
