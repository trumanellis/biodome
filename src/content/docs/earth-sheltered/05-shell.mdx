## Key Topics

- Light straw-clay mix: 12:1 straw-to-clay ratio, hand-packed into wattle basket
- Wall thickness: 30–40cm, provides R-20 to R-25 insulation
- EPDM membrane: 1.2mm thickness, applied over purlin deck with 30cm overlaps
- Burlap mesh reinforcement: laid over EPDM, receives lime-earth render
- Lime-earth render: 3:1 sand-to-lime, troweled in two coats
- Earth-contact waterproofing: EPDM wraps down into gabion fill, sealed with bentonite clay
