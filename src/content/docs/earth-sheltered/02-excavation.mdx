## Key Topics

- Site selection: south-facing slope, 15–30° angle, stable soil (clay/loam preferred)
- Excavation dimensions: 3m deep × 5m wide × 6m long cut
- Cut profile: vertical rear wall, stepped sides for gabion courses
- Drainage design: geotextile wrap, perforated pipe at base of gabion walls
- Soil storage: stockpile topsoil for living roof substrate
- Compaction and grading: level floor, proper drainage fall
