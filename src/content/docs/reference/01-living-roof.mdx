The living roof is what makes the BioDome truly fire-resistant and thermally regulated. A layer of growing plants and soil on top of the roof structure absorbs heat, holds moisture, and blends the structure into the landscape.

<Steps>

1. **Sheathing**

   Cork board or dense wood fiber board over purlins.

2. **Waterproofing**

   EPDM pond liner (1mm minimum) fully lapped and sealed.

3. **Root Barrier**

   Drainage mat + filter fabric to prevent roots from penetrating the waterproof membrane.

4. **Growing Medium**

   10-15cm lightweight substrate (pumice/perlite/compost mix).

5. **Planting**

   Sedums, native succulents, drought-tolerant groundcovers.

</Steps>

## Central Opening Waterproofing

The ~1m diameter central opening is the lowest point of the dome apex. Without proper detailing, water from the living roof drains toward this opening.

- **Raised curb:** Install a 150mm high curb around the opening using cork or treated timber. EPDM membrane wraps up and over this curb.
- **Metal flashing collar:** A pre-formed aluminum or stainless steel collar (1.2m outer diameter) sits atop the curb with a 45° drip lip directing water outward.
- **Drainage relief:** Cut 4 small notches (25mm wide × 10mm deep) in the curb at cardinal points to allow trapped water to escape to the main roof drainage layer.
- **Skylight or cap:** The opening should be sealed with a glazed dome, operable hatch, or removable weatherproof cap. Do not leave open to weather.

## Roof Overflow Protection

Living roofs can retain significant water during intense winter storms. If the drainage mat capacity is exceeded, water must have an escape path.

- **Overflow scuppers:** Install 2-4 overflow outlets (75mm diameter PVC pipe through EPDM, sealed with rubber boot) at the low points of the roof perimeter.
- **Outlet height:** Set scupper inlet 50mm above normal drainage layer level — water only exits when drainage is overwhelmed.
- **Discharge:** Direct overflow away from foundation via splash blocks or gravel drainage strip.
