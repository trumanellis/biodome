## Quality Control Checkpoints

Use these measurements to verify your build is within acceptable limits.

| Checkpoint | When | Acceptable | Action if Exceeded |
|------------|------|------------|-------------------|
| Post plumb | After setting | ≤ 10mm over 3m | Re-seat post; add wedges at base |
| Ring beam level | Before loading | ≤ 15mm around circle | Shim post tops; re-cut notches |
| Roof center gap | After tower removal | Tips within 20mm | Add compression ring; adjust wire |
| Post settlement | Years 1, 3, 5 | ≤ 15mm total | Investigate drainage; shim |
| Wire lashing | Annual | No slack; sings when plucked | Re-tension or replace |
| Pole moisture | Before assembly | ≤ 20% (pin meter) | Continue drying; do not install |
| Interior humidity | Winter occupancy | ≤ 65% sustained | Increase ventilation; dehumidifier |
