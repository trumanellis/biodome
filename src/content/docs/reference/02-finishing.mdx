## Lime Render

- **Base coat:** 1:3 lime:sand, 15mm thick
- **Finish coat:** 1:2.5 lime:fine sand, 5mm thick
- **Limewash:** 3-4 coats for final protection

:::tip[Why Lime, Not Cement]
Lime render is breathable — it allows moisture to pass through the wall rather than trapping it. Cement render on straw-clay walls creates a vapor barrier that leads to rot. Lime also self-heals small cracks through carbonation.

## Windows & Doors

:::caution[Use Chestnut for Precision Joinery]
While eucalyptus is ideal for structural framing (posts, wattle poles, rafters, purlins), its tendency to warp and twist as it dries makes it unsuitable for **precision millwork**. Window frames, door frames, and mullions require dimensional stability for tight weatherseals and smooth operation. For these applications, use **chestnut (*Castanea sativa*)** — a native Mediterranean hardwood with excellent stability, natural rot resistance from high tannin content, and a long tradition of use in Portuguese building.

**Deep reveals** (40cm+) create natural window seats.

### Sill Pan (All Windows)
- **Slope:** Window sills must slope outward at minimum 15° (1:4 ratio)
- **Pan liner:** Install EPDM or metal pan liner beneath window frame, extending 50mm up frame jambs and 100mm beyond sill edge
- **Drip edge:** Sill must project 40mm beyond wall face with undercut drip groove
- **End dams:** Turn up pan liner at both ends to prevent water running along sill into wall

### Head Flashing (All Openings)
- **Z-flashing:** Install galvanized or aluminum Z-flashing above all window and door heads
- **Extension:** Flashing must extend 50mm beyond frame on each side
- **Overlap:** Lime render overlaps top leg of flashing; bottom leg overlaps frame head

### Door Threshold
- **Elevation:** Door threshold must be minimum 50mm above exterior grade
- **Drainage:** Slope exterior surface away from threshold at 2% minimum
- **Weather strip:** Install adjustable door sweep or threshold seal

:::danger[Avoid Roundwood Frames for Exterior Openings]
Roundwood makes attractive interior trim but performs poorly at weathered exterior openings. The irregular surface creates gaps that are difficult to seal. Use kiln-dried, dimensioned timber (chestnut, oak, or treated softwood) for all window and door frames exposed to weather.

## Floor Options

1. **Earthen floor:** Clay/sand/linseed finish (beautiful, requires maintenance)
2. **Flagstone on sand:** Durable, attractive, low maintenance
3. **Polished concrete:** Practical, can integrate radiant heating
