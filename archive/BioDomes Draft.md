# Biodomes

I know at least 3 people who have lost their homes to fire season in this part of Portugal. Test

It never used to be this way but invasives have a way of way of becoming permanent additions to an ecosystem and we’ve got to learn how to live in harmony with them.

The problem with eucalyptus (or fire trees as they’re known in their native Australia) is that they have no natural predators.

Their resinous tissue reflects all but the cuddly koala, and we got none of those around to make a dent.

But there’s another predator afoot with an insatiable appetite that just needs to develop a taste for eucalyptus flesh.

The widespread eucalyptus forest fires are in part responsible for the arrival of this herbivore.

Every fire season leaves behind charred stone ruins of homes that used to be, homes that need rebuilding.

Do you know who learned to live harmoniously with fire? The Native Americans.

Fires were intentionally cultivated to thin the forest and make way for new life amongst the newly opened prairies, places that would attract bison to live and stay.

Now I’m not suggesting that we intentionally clear the forest with control burns, modern Portugal is a different reality to pre-Columbian North America.

But the similarity is the predictability of having a yearly fire season.

Of course many a wigwam would have been lost each year, but these were cheap and easy to reconstruct.

Today, the rebuilding of a charred home can quickly bankrupt a victim. And where are they going to stay during the multi-year process? Whole families stuck tightly together in a cold camper trying to survive wet winters while they rebuild with expensive and toxic manmade materials.

If only we could solve two problems with one dome. How do we unleash the insatiable predator of home construction against the very trees that are destroying our homes? And how do we selectively target their young so that they stop coming back?

The solution exists already in the heart of the problem.

We find a way to construct quick, easy, and cheap structures from young flexible eucalyptus poles in a way that doesn’t resist the euc’s natural tendency to twist as it dries.

The idea came to me in the wake of a visit from my in-laws during which they taught us how to build a wattle fence around our garden to keep the wild boars away.

We then interplanted the fence with wisteria and passion fruit vines to replace it when it rots away in 5 years.

I started to play with the design by directing the poles at 45 degrees instead of 90.

From here, it was a small step to imagine this trellis wrapping back on itself to create a giant inverted wicker basket dome. And when you weave a basket, you want the young flexible ones: 1-5 years old because they will bend easily into place and then dry in mutually supported tension. That dome will shift over time as each euc dries and twists individually but there’s a ton of flex to the whole structure, so no big deal.

But how do we make this more useful than a shade pergola?

Wouldn’t it be cool if we could let the light in but keep rain out?

Wrap the whole thing in greenhouse plastic and lash it down with rope. That’ll keep it dry on the inside, the first step towards living off-grid. Add a simple door cut in one of the arches, and we’ve got a greenhouse that will keep things dry.

Let’s progressively make a few longevity improvements using widely available and cheap materials.

### Gabbion Cage Foundation

First biggest step is getting the feet dry - let’s get those euc poles out of the dirt. So we begin with a classic Gabbion Cage footprint for the walls, basically a metal cage filled with medium sized stones. This gabion wall can even extend partially underground where the bottom is filled with smaller gravel and wrapped in geotextile fabric — a kind of built-in French drain.

Simply anchoring the pole ends the middle of this cage will significantly improve the lifetime of the structure but we can further treat the ends with borax and/or wrap them in EPDM. Furthermore, we’d want to debark the newly harvested eucalyptus with a hammer and treat the all surfaces with a natural fungicide and insect repellent like borax and copper sulfate.

Furthermore, covering the whole structure with the greenhouse plastic will add years of life to the poles. And as they dry and shift, the rope lashings (made from recycled PET rope) can be adjusted. You’d also want to wrap any sharp edges of the poles that contact the greenhouse plastic with some sort of cushioning fabric.

These AI renderings are not entirely correct, but you get the idea. I couldn’t get ChatGPT to draw both the eucalyptus wattle dome and rope lashings at the same time. And obviously it’s going to need a door. Ventilation flaps could be installed around the upper dome to allow hot air to escape in the summer. This is starting to look pretty feasible as a greenhouse/warm dry room.
